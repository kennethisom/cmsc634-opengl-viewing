To my knowledge, everything is implemented and working correctly including the 634 portion of the assignment.  The mouse is permanently assigned to moving the view so the only way to exit the program is to press escape or alt-tab to another window at which point you'll have control of the mouse again unless you refocus on the OpenGL program.

I also implemented jumping for extra credit.  Per Dr. Olano's instruction to do whatever made sense, I programmed it so that while the jump is taking place, the surface normals do not have any affect or the alignment of the view (aka I turn the 634 portion off during the jump).  As far as I know this is working completely as requested in the extra credit description.
